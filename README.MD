# Spare Parts Inventory Assistant

This is a simple C program that asks which part you need and checks if it is in stock.

## Parts in stock
- hydraulic pump
- PLC module
- servo motor

## How it works
Type the name of a part and the program will say if it is available.  
Type "Show stock" and it lists all parts.  
If you type something wrong 3 times, it shows all parts.  
The program ends when you choose a valid part.
